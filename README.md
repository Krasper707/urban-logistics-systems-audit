# Asymmetric Vertical Micro-Fulfillment
### A Systems Audit of High-Density Urban Retail Nodes

> "While enterprise logistics spend millions on mechanical conveyors, traditional Indian retail nodes achieve 0.9s retrieval latency using $0 structural conduits."

## Overview
This repository contains a technical report performing a first-principles audit of vertical logistics in constrained urban environments. It analyzes the **Vertical Decoupling** strategy where inventory is separated from the interaction layer via gravity-assisted conduits.

## Key Findings
* **Deterministic Latency:** $t = \sqrt{2h/g} \approx 0.9s$.
* **Throughput Multiplier:** 15x increase in retrieval speed compared to staircase-based human conveyors.
* **Mechanical Inductive Bias:** Leveraged physics (gravity) to create a zero-energy, self-healing transport layer.

## Technical Concepts Explored
* **Vertical Decoupling:** Separating State (Inventory) from Processing (Sales).
* **Digital P2P Signaling:** Transitioning from analog broadcast (shouting) to digital protocols (WhatsApp).
* **Predictive Pre-fetching:** Proposed integration of SLMs for intent-based SKU localization.
